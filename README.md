## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-metadata-extractor.git
   cd image-metadata-extractor
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Drag and drop an image file onto the designated area, or click to browse and select a file.
3. The application processes the image and displays its metadata.
4. For JPEG images with EXIF data, additional information like camera settings will be displayed.
5. Click "Show Advanced Metadata" to view all extracted metadata fields.

## How It Works

The application uses JavaScript's built-in APIs to extract metadata from images:

1. Basic file information is extracted using the File API.
2. Image dimensions are determined by loading the image into an HTML Image element.
3. EXIF data is extracted by parsing the binary data of JPEG files.
4. All processing happens client-side in the browser, ensuring privacy.

## Privacy

This application processes all images locally in your browser. No image data is ever sent to a server, ensuring complete privacy.

## Limitations

- EXIF extraction is currently limited to JPEG images.
- Some proprietary metadata formats may not be fully supported.
- GPS location data display requires valid EXIF location information.
